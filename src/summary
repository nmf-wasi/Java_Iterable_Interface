If we use iterable class, we can custom define how to iterate over the object list/array

if we are going to use iterable class, we need to implement Iterator class as well, where we define how to iterate

Later, if we change the Array to an ArrayList or a Linked List, we can just change the implementation of hasNext() and next() and other things do not need to be changed.
